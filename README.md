# Fanfiction-data-analysis
I was bored and i love fanfics, so i created this little note with data analysis from ao3 fanfiction

There are no author information or texts of work present, only their id and information such as genre or rating, so i hope it wont be a problem for authors(i know, you do care about your privacy and usage of your works)

There are a lot of information written inside the notebook with my thoughts and processing on situation. Its my first project at data analysis with using python(before that i had to do it by hand, thank you organic chemistry)
And what i can say - need more data! Really, 60 fanfics was not enough
